### User Story: Bug Report Submission to Jira API

**As a** website user,
**I want** my bug report to be sent directly to a Jira project after I submit it,
**so that** it can be tracked and handled properly by the development team.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Given** I'm a user who has completed the bug report form,
   **when** I click 'Submit' or equivalent,
   **then** the form should gather all the information (including hidden fields), convert it into the appropriate format, and send it to Jira using the Jira API.

2. **Given** I'm a user who has submitted a bug report,
   **when** the bug report is being processed,
   **then** I should see a loading or progress indicator showing that the report is being sent.

3. **Given** I'm a user who has submitted a bug report,
   **when** the bug report has been successfully sent to Jira,
   **then** I should see a success message indicating that the bug report was submitted successfully.

4. **Given** I'm a user who has submitted a bug report,
   **when** the bug report fails to be sent to Jira for any reason,
   **then** I should see an error message indicating that the submission failed and providing me with options to retry or save the report to try again later.
