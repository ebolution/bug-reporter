### User Story: Popup Interface Creation

**As a** website user,
**I want** to see a button or an option on every webpage that, when clicked, opens up a popup,
**so that** I can easily access the bug reporting feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Given** I'm a user on a webpage,
   **when** I'm interacting with the page,
   **then** I should see an option to report a bug.

2. **Given** I'm a user who wants to report a bug,
   **when** I click on the bug reporting button,
   **then** a popup should open with a form for bug report submission.

3. **Given** I'm a user who has opened the bug report popup,
   **when** I have not finished writing my report and I accidentally click outside the popup or press the ESC key,
   **then** the popup should not close, or it should ask for confirmation before closing to avoid losing the written data.

4. **Given** I'm a user who has opened the bug report popup,
   **when** I click on a 'Close' button or option inside the popup,
   **then** the popup should close, discarding any unsaved information.

5. **Given** I'm a user who wants to report a bug,
   **when** I have finished writing my report and click on 'Submit' or equivalent,
   **then** the popup should close, indicating that the report is being processed.

6. **Given** I'm a user who has reported a bug,
   **when** I try to open the bug reporting popup again,
   **then** the popup should open clean, ready for a new report.
