### User Story: Error Handling and User Feedback

**As a** website user,
**I want** clear feedback on the bug reporting process, especially in case of any errors,
**so that** I can understand if my report was successful or if I need to take further action.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Given** I'm a user who has interacted with the bug report form,
   **when** an error occurs during any part of the process (form filling, screenshot capture, image attachment, Jira submission),
   **then** I should see a clear and understandable error message indicating what went wrong.

2. **Given** I'm a user who sees an error message,
   **when** I read the message,
   **then** it should guide me on what to do next to resolve the issue or where to seek further assistance if needed.

3. **Given** I'm a user who has submitted a bug report,
   **when** the bug report is successfully sent to Jira,
   **then** I should receive a confirmation message, possibly with a Jira ticket number or link for tracking.

4. **Given** I'm a user who has encountered an error,
   **when** I choose to retry or redo the action that led to the error,
   **then** the process should restart smoothly, maintaining any input I've already made where possible.
