### User Story: Bug Report Information Collection

**As a** website user,
**I want** a simple and intuitive form in the bug report popup,
**so that** I can easily input the necessary information about the bug I've encountered.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Given** I'm a user who has opened the bug report popup,
   **when** I look at the form,
   **then** I should see clear fields for me to input a description of the bug.

2. **Given** I'm a user inputting a bug description,
   **when** I'm typing in the description field,
   **then** there should be no character limit, allowing me to provide as much detail as necessary.

3. **Given** I'm a user who wants to report a bug,
   **when** I interact with the form,
   **then** the form should automatically (hidden from the user) capture the URL of the page I'm reporting about, browser information, screen resolution, and any other relevant information.

4. **Given** I'm a user who wants to report a bug,
   **when** I interact with the form,
   **then** the form should automatically (hidden from the user) capture the date and time of the report.

5. **Given** I'm a user who has completed the bug report form,
   **when** I review the form before submitting,
   **then** I should see all the information (description and any attachments) I've provided in a clear and organized manner.

6. **Given** I'm a user who has provided all the required information in the form,
   **when** I click 'Submit' or equivalent,
   **then** the form should validate all the fields to ensure the required information is filled in before sending it for processing.
