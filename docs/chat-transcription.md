**I want** to see a button or an option on every webpage that, when clicked, opens up a popup,
**so that** I can easily access the bug reporting feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Given** I'm a user on a webpage,
   **when** I'm interacting with the page,
   **then** I should see an option to report a bug.

2. **Given** I'm a user who wants to report a bug,
   **when** I click on the bug reporting button,
   **then** a popup should open with a form for bug report submission.

3. **Given** I'm a user who has opened the bug report popup,
   **when** I have not finished writing my report and I accidentally click outside the popup or press the ESC key,
   **then** the popup should not close, or it should ask for confirmation before closing to avoid losing the written data.

4. **Given** I'm a user who has opened the bug report popup,
   **when** I click on a 'Close' button or option inside the popup,
   **then** the popup should close, discarding any unsaved information.

Me:
> I want to take a modular approach for this development, so we will endup creating a single bundle. However, the code must be organized keeping SOLID principles in mind and having unit testing as a base. Propose a file structure and a general guideline for all the project.

ChatGPT:
For creating a scalable and maintainable JavaScript library, it's important to consider the best practices of modularity, file organization, and coding standards. The structure and guidelines proposed below align with the SOLID principles and include a testing strategy.

### File Structure:

The following is a proposed directory structure:

```
root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Popup/
│   │   ├── Form/
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── AttachmentUploader/
│   │   └── Screenshot/
│   ├── helpers/
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── JiraService/
│   ├── models/
│   └── index.js
│
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── e2e/
│
├── public/
│   └── css/
│       └── styles.css
│
├── .eslintrc.json
├── .babelrc
├── jest.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

**components/**: Each major feature (Popup, Form, Button, etc.) should be organized in its own folder. This helps to keep the components modular and maintainable. Each component should be responsible for a single functionality as per Single Responsibility Principle.

**helpers/**: This directory is for utility functions which can be used throughout the project, making it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

**services/**: Services like `JiraService` will be responsible for sending data to the Jira API, encapsulating this logic away from the rest of the code. This aligns with the Dependency Inversion Principle.

**models/**: This is for data models that define the shape of objects like a `BugReport`.

**tests/**: Contains all the test files, further categorized into unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests.

**public/**: Contains static files that will be served, like CSS.

### General Guidelines:

1. **Coding Style**: Adopt a coding style guide, such as Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide. Use ESLint for enforcing this style guide.

2. **Modularity**: Try to keep your functions and modules small, each doing one thing (Single Responsibility Principle). This makes them easier to test, debug, and understand.

3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first, then write the code to make the tests pass. This will lead to a robust and bug-free codebase. Use Jest for unit and integration testing.

4. **Documentation**: Document the functionality of each component, function, or method using JSDoc notation. This will help maintainers and developers to understand the purpose of the code.

5. **Error Handling**: Ensure that every part of the application which may encounter an error has proper error handling. This will help in debugging and also improve the user experience.

6. **Code Review**: Before merging any branch, ensure that the code has been reviewed by at least one other developer. This helps maintain code quality and catch bugs before they reach production.

Remember that the proposed file structure and guidelines can and should be adjusted as per the specific needs of your team and project.

Me:
> Implement user story 1. Make sure to follow the structure and guidelines you just mentioned above, and make the code as much complete as possible.

ChatGPT:
Implementing the first user story, which involves creating a popup module, will require a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this case, we'll use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and universal compatibility. However, you might choose to use a framework or library like React, Angular, or Vue.js, depending on your requirements.

Our "Popup" component will be created in the `/src/components/Popup` folder:

#### 1. Create the Popup HTML structure:

```html
<!-- src/components/Popup/popup.html -->
<div id="bug-report-popup" class="popup">
  <div class="popup-content">
    <span class="close">&times;</span>
    <p>Report a Bug</p>
    <!-- Bug report form will be inserted here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. Create the Popup CSS:

```css
/* public/css/styles.css */
.popup {
  display: none; 
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 1; 
  padding-top: 100px; 
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%; 
  height: 100%; 
  overflow: auto; 
  background-color: rgb(0,0,0); 
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4); 
}

.popup-content {
  background-color: #fefefe;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #888;
  width: 80%;
}
```

#### 3. Create the Popup JavaScript:

```javascript
// src/components/Popup/Popup.js
class Popup {
  constructor() {
    this.popupEl = document.getElementById('bug-report-popup');
    this.closeBtn = document.getElementsByClassName('close')[0];

    // Event listener to close the popup
    this.closeBtn.onclick = () => {
      this.popupEl.style.display = "none";
    }

    // Event listener to close the popup when clicking outside
    window.onclick = (event) => {
      if (event.target == this.popupEl) {
        this.popupEl.style.display = "none";
      }
    }
  }

  open() {
    this.popupEl.style.display = "block";
  }

  close() {
    this.popupEl.style.display = "none";
  }

  setContent(content) {
    this.popupEl.querySelector('.popup-content').innerHTML += content;
  }
}

export default Popup;
```

This `Popup` class creates a new Popup object that can be opened or closed, and can have content added to it. The methods `open`, `close` and `setContent` encapsulate the behavior of the popup, keeping the responsibility inside this class (Single Responsibility Principle).

To display the popup, we will use the `open` method from any part of the application. The content of the form (User Story 2) will be added using the `setContent` method.

#### 4. Unit tests for the Popup component:

```javascript
// tests/unit/Popup.test.js
import Popup from '../../src/components/Popup/Popup.js';

test('Popup opens', () => {
  const popup = new Popup();
  popup.open();
  expect(popup.popupEl.style.display).toBe('block');
});

test('Popup closes', () => {
  const popup = new Popup();
  popup.open();
  popup.close();
  expect(popup.popupEl.style.display).toBe('none');
});

test('Popup sets content', () => {
  const popup = new Popup();
  popup.setContent('<p>Test Content</p>');
  expect(popup.popupEl.querySelector('.popup-content').innerHTML).toContain('Test Content');
});
```

These tests check if the Popup opens, closes, and

sets content correctly. They can be run using a test runner like Jest.

Please note that the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case, tech stack, and the UI library you're using. Always write tests to verify the correctness of your code.

Me:
> Implement user story 2. Make sure to follow the structure and guidelines you just mentioned above, and make the code as much complete as possible, and remember this request for the rest of task like this.

ChatGPT:
To implement user story 2, we'll be creating a "Form" component that users can interact with to enter their bug report details. We'll follow a similar structure and process as for user story 1.

#### 1. Create the Form HTML structure:

We'll create a simple HTML form structure within our popup for capturing the bug details.

```html
<!-- src/components/Form/form.html -->
<form id="bug-report-form">
  <label for="description">Description:</label><br>
  <textarea id="description" name="description"></textarea><br>
  <label for="screenshot">Screenshot:</label><br>
  <input type="file" id="screenshot" name="screenshot" accept="image/*"><br>
  <label for="attachments">Attachments:</label><br>
  <input type="file" id="attachments" name="attachments" accept="image/*" multiple><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

#### 2. Create the Form JavaScript:

The Form component will handle capturing form data and submission events.

```javascript
// src/components/Form/Form.js
class Form {
  constructor(popup) {
    this.formEl = document.getElementById('bug-report-form');
    this.popup = popup;

    // Event listener to handle form submission
    this.formEl.onsubmit = (event) => {
      event.preventDefault();

      // Gather form data
      const description = document.getElementById('description').value;
      const screenshot = document.getElementById('screenshot').files[0];
      const attachments = document.getElementById('attachments').files;

      // Construct bug report object
      const bugReport = {
        description,
        screenshot,
        attachments,
        url: window.location.href,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        browserInfo: navigator.userAgent,
        screenResolution: `${window.screen.width}x${window.screen.height}`,
      };

      // Dispatch event with bug report data
      const event = new CustomEvent('bugReportSubmitted', { detail: bugReport });
      document.dispatchEvent(event);

      // Close the form
      this.popup.close();
    }
  }
}

export default Form;
```

In this class, the Form constructor takes a Popup instance as its argument, allowing the form to close the popup when it's submitted. When the form is submitted, it gathers all the necessary information, including the hidden fields, constructs a bug report object, and dispatches a 'bugReportSubmitted' event with this object as its detail.

To handle the form submission and creating a Jira ticket, we will listen for this event in our main application code (which will be implemented in user story 3).

#### 3. Unit tests for the Form component:

```javascript
// tests/unit/Form.test.js
import Form from '../../src/components/Form/Form.js';
import Popup from '../../src/components/Popup/Popup.js';

test('Form gathers data and dispatches event on submit', () => {
  const popup = new Popup();
  const form = new Form(popup);

  // Simulate form data
  document.getElementById('description').value = 'Test bug report';
  document.getElementById('screenshot').files = [new File([], 'screenshot.png')];
  document.getElementById('attachments').files = [new File([], 'attachment.png')];

  const eventHandler = jest.fn();
  document.addEventListener('bugReportSubmitted', eventHandler);

  // Simulate form submission
  const submitEvent = new Event('submit');
  form.formEl.dispatchEvent(submitEvent);

  expect(eventHandler).toBeCalled();
  expect(popup.popupEl.style.display).toBe('none');
});
```

This test checks if the form correctly gathers data and dispatches an event when submitted, and

closes the popup. It simulates form data and submission, and checks that an event listener for 'bugReportSubmitted' is called and the popup is closed.

As with user story 1, please note that the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case, tech stack, and the UI library you're using. Always write tests to verify the correctness of your code.

Me:
> Implement user story 3

ChatGPT:
For user story 3, we'll be creating a service that sends data to the Jira API to create a bug report. We'll use the Fetch API for sending HTTP requests.

#### 1. Create the JiraService JavaScript:

The JiraService will be responsible for sending the bug report data to the Jira API.

```javascript
// src/services/JiraService/JiraService.js
class JiraService {
  constructor(apiUrl, projectKey, apiToken) {
    this.apiUrl = apiUrl;
    this.projectKey = projectKey;
    this.apiToken = apiToken;
  }

  createIssue(bugReport) {
    const issueData = {
      fields: {
        project: {
          key: this.projectKey,
        },
        summary: bugReport.description.substring(0, 200), // Jira summary has a limit of 255 chars
        description: JSON.stringify(bugReport), // Convert bugReport object to JSON string for Jira description
        issuetype: {
          name: "Bug",
        },
      },
    };

    return fetch(`${this.apiUrl}/rest/api/2/issue/`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Basic ${btoa(`apiToken:${this.apiToken}`)}`, // Basic auth requires base64-encoded "username:password"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(issueData),
    })
      .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return response.json();
      })
      .catch(e => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation: ' + e.message);
      });
  }
}

export default JiraService;
```

In this class, the `createIssue` method takes a bug report object, converts it to the format required by the Jira API, and sends a POST request to create a new issue.

Please note that this example assumes that you're using Jira's REST API v2 and a Basic auth token for authentication. Your actual implementation may vary depending on your specific Jira setup.

#### 2. Integration tests for the JiraService:

```javascript
// tests/integration/JiraService.test.js
import JiraService from '../../src/services/JiraService/JiraService.js';

test('JiraService sends data to Jira API and receives response', async () => {
  const jiraService = new JiraService('https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net', 'PROJECT_KEY', 'API_TOKEN');
  
  // Mock bug report data
  const bugReport = {
    description: 'Test bug report',
    screenshot: 'screenshot.png',

  );

  const response = await jiraService.createIssue(bugReport);
  expect(response).toHaveProperty('id');
  expect(response).toHaveProperty('key');
 

 expect(response).toHaveProperty('self');

This test checks if the JiraService correctly sends data to the Jira API and receives a response. It uses Jest's function mocking feature to mock the Fetch API and simulate a successful API response.

As always, remember to write tests to verify the correctness of your code. The actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and tech stack.

> Implement user story 3

ChatGPT:
For user story 3, we'll be creating a service that sends data to the Jira API to create a bug report. We'll use the Fetch API for sending HTTP requests.

#### 1. Create the JiraService JavaScript:

The JiraService will be responsible for sending the bug report data to the Jira API.

```javascript
// src/services/JiraService/JiraService.js
class JiraService {
  constructor(apiUrl, projectKey, apiToken) {
    this.apiUrl = apiUrl;
    this.projectKey = projectKey;
    this.apiToken = apiToken;
  }

  createIssue(bugReport) {
    const issueData = {
      fields: {
        project: {
          key: this.projectKey,
        },
        summary: bugReport.description.substring(0, 200), // Jira summary has a limit of 255 chars
        description: JSON.stringify(bugReport), // Convert bugReport object to JSON string for Jira description
        issuetype: {
          name: "Bug",
        },
      },
    };

    return fetch(`${this.apiUrl}/rest/api/2/issue/`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Basic ${btoa(`apiToken:${this.apiToken}`)}`, // Basic auth requires base64-encoded "username:password"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(issueData),
    })
      .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return response.json();
      })
      .catch(e => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation: ' + e.message);
      });
  }
}

export default JiraService;
```

In this class, the `createIssue` method takes a bug report object, converts it to the format required by the Jira API, and sends a POST request to create a new issue.

Please note that this example assumes that you're using Jira's REST API v2 and a Basic auth token for authentication. Your actual implementation may vary depending on your specific Jira setup.

#### 2. Integration tests for the JiraService:

```javascript
// tests/integration/JiraService.test.js
import JiraService from '../../src/services/JiraService/JiraService.js';

test('JiraService sends data to Jira API and receives response', async () => {
  const jiraService = new JiraService('https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net', 'PROJECT_KEY', 'API_TOKEN');
  
  // Mock bug report data
  const bugReport = {
    description: 'Test bug report',
    screenshot: 'screenshot.png',
    attachments: ['attachment.png'],
    url: 'http://localhost',
    timestamp: '2023-06-22T10:20:30Z',
    browserInfo: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3',
    screenResolution: '1920x1080',
  };

  // Mock fetch API
  global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({ id: '12345', key: 'PROJECT_KEY-1', self: 'https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/12345' }),
    })
  );

  const response = await jiraService.createIssue(bugReport);
  expect(response).toHaveProperty('id');
  expect(response).toHaveProperty('key');
 

 expect(response).toHaveProperty('self');
});
```

This test checks if the JiraService correctly sends data to the Jira API and receives a response. It uses Jest's function mocking feature to mock the Fetch API and simulate a successful API response.

As always, remember to write tests to verify the correctness of your code. The actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and tech stack.

Me:
> Implement user story 4

ChatGPT:
To implement User Story 4, we will be integrating the Popup, Form, and JiraService components and handling the bug report submission event. This integration step is key to ensuring all parts of our application work together.

Create a main file for our application, which will be responsible for initializing our components and handling events:

```javascript
// src/main.js
import Popup from './components/Popup/Popup.js';
import Form from './components/Form/Form.js';
import JiraService from './services/JiraService/JiraService.js';

// Initialize components
const popup = new Popup();
const form = new Form(popup);
const jiraService = new JiraService('https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net', 'PROJECT_KEY', 'API_TOKEN');

// Event listener for 'bugReportSubmitted' events
document.addEventListener('bugReportSubmitted', async (event) => {
  const bugReport = event.detail;

  // Send bug report to Jira
  const response = await jiraService.createIssue(bugReport);
  console.log(`Bug reported to Jira: ${response.key}`);
});
```

In this main file, we first import and initialize our Popup, Form, and JiraService components. We then set up an event listener for 'bugReportSubmitted' events, which sends the bug report to Jira using our JiraService.

Please note that this is a simple console log response for a successful Jira issue creation. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely want to display a user-friendly message in your UI.

#### Unit tests for main.js

As this script mainly integrates other components which we have already tested, it's not necessarily required to write additional tests here. However, you could write an integration test to check if the bug report is successfully submitted when the form is submitted.

Remember to modify the code as per your requirements and tech stack.

Me:
> Implement user story 5

ChatGPT:
For user story 5, we'll be creating a "loadScript" function that adds the main JavaScript file to the DOM.

#### 1. Create the loadScript JavaScript function:

This function will dynamically add a script tag to the page that loads our main JavaScript file.

```javascript
// src/loadScript.js
function loadScript() {
  const script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'dist/main.bundle.js'; // The path to the bundled JavaScript file
  script.async = true;
  document.body.appendChild(script);
}

export default loadScript;
```

You can use this function in the context of your project, possibly calling it when the page loads, or on a specific user interaction, depending on your requirements.

#### 2. Unit test for the loadScript function:

```javascript
// tests/unit/loadScript.test.js
import loadScript from '../../src/loadScript.js';

test('loadScript adds script to body', () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = '';
  loadScript();
  expect(document.body.innerHTML).toContain('script');
  expect(document.body.innerHTML).toContain('dist/main.bundle.js');
});
```

This test checks if the `loadScript` function correctly adds a script tag to the body with the correct `src` attribute.

Again, remember to write tests to verify the correctness of your code. The actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and tech stack.

> Let's write some docs. First, what do a developer need to do to start developing this tool for improves and fixes?

ChatGPT:
# Developer Documentation

## Getting Started with Bug Reporter JavaScript Library

This JavaScript library allows users to report bugs directly from the website they are using. Users can describe the issue, upload screenshots, and attach any additional files. The library then sends this data to Jira and creates a new bug report.

### Requirements
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (version 6.x or higher)
- Git
- Your favorite text editor or IDE

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository from Github to your local machine. Run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

Remember to replace 'username' and 'repository' with the username and repository name of the Github repository.

### Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate into the project folder and install the project's dependencies with npm. Run the following command:

```sh
cd repository
npm install
```

### Development Workflow

This project is organized according to the SOLID principles and takes a modular approach to JavaScript development. The project structure is as follows:

```
src/
  components/
    Popup/
      Popup.js
      popup.html
    Form/
      Form.js
      form.html
  services/
    JiraService.js
  main.js
  loadScript.js
tests/
  unit/
    Popup.test.js
    Form.test.js
    loadScript.test.js
  integration/
    JiraService.test.js
```

For any new features or fixes, start by writing user stories to define the scope of work. Then, create a new branch for the feature or fix:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Next, implement your feature or fix in the appropriate component or service, following the SOLID principles. Each JavaScript class should have its own file, and any HTML templates associated with a component should be in the same directory as their JavaScript file.

After writing your code, write unit tests to verify its correctness. The unit tests for each component or service should be in a file named `component-name.test.js` or `service-name.test.js`, located in the `tests/unit/` directory.

Once your feature or fix is complete and all tests are passing, commit your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add your feature or fix"
```

Finally, push your changes to Github and open a pull request for your branch:

```sh
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Build

The project uses Webpack as a module bundler. To build the project, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a bundled JavaScript file at `dist/main.bundle.js`.

## Testing

The project uses Jest for unit and integration testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

## Deployment

After building the project, the `dist/main.bundle.js` file can be added to any website to enable the bug reporter functionality. The `loadScript.js` function can be used to dynamically add the script to the page. Remember to replace the Jira API URL, project key, and API token with your own values before deployment.

Happy coding!

> Now write a doc from the integrator user point of view. What do integrators need to do to make this tool available in their websites?

ChatGPT:
# Integrator Documentation

## Integrating the Bug Reporter JavaScript Library into Your Website

The Bug Reporter is a JavaScript library that enables your users to report bugs directly from your website. This document explains how to integrate this library into your website.

### Requirements

Before integrating the Bug Reporter library into your website, please ensure that you have:

- The bundled JavaScript file for the Bug Reporter library (`main.bundle.js`).
- An active Jira instance with a project for collecting bug reports.
- An API token for your Jira instance.

### Integrating the Bug Reporter Library

To integrate the Bug Reporter library into your website, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the `main.bundle.js` file to your website's server:**

   This JavaScript file contains the bundled code for the Bug Reporter library. You can place it in any directory that is accessible to your website's frontend code. For example, you might put it in a `scripts/` directory.

2. **Add the `main.bundle.js` file to your website:**

   You need to include the `main.bundle.js` file in your website's HTML. You can add it with a `<script>` tag in your HTML files, like so:

   ```html
   <script src="scripts/main.bundle.js" async></script>
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the `loadScript` function provided by the library to dynamically add the `main.bundle.js` file to your website. The `loadScript` function should be called when the page loads or when a specific user interaction happens, depending on your requirements.

   Please replace `"scripts/main.bundle.js"` with the actual path to the `main.bundle.js` file on your server.

3. **Configure the JiraService:**

   The Bug Reporter library uses a service named JiraService to send bug reports to your Jira instance. You need to provide the URL of your Jira instance, the key of the project where bug reports should be created, and your API token.

   You can do this by modifying the JiraService initialization in the `main.js` file:

   ```javascript
   const jiraService = new JiraService('https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net', 'PROJECT_KEY', 'API_TOKEN');
   ```

   Please replace `'https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net'`, `'PROJECT_KEY'`, and `'API_TOKEN'` with the URL of your Jira instance, your project key, and your API token, respectively.

Once you've followed these steps, the Bug Reporter library should be successfully integrated into your website. Your users can now report bugs directly from your website, and these bug reports will be sent to your Jira project.

> generate the content of the package.json file

ChatGPT:
The `package.json` file is a key part of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including the project's name, version, description, and dependencies. Here's an example of what your `package.json` file might look like for this project:

```json
{
  "name": "bug-reporter-js-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A JavaScript library for reporting bugs directly from any website to Jira",
  "main": "src/main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/username/repository.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "bug-reporting",
    "javascript-library",
    "jira-integration"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/username/repository/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/username/repository#readme",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.6.3",
    "webpack": "^5.37.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.7.0",
    "babel-loader": "^8.2.2",
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0"
  }
}
```

You will need to replace `"username/repository"` with the actual username and repository name for your Github repository, and `"Your Name"` with your actual name or the name of your organization.

The `"scripts"` section contains shortcuts for running common commands. In this case, `"npm test"` will run the Jest test suite, and `"npm run build"` will run Webpack to bundle your JavaScript code.

The `"devDependencies"` section lists the project's development dependencies. These are libraries that are not required for the library to run, but are needed for development tasks like testing and bundling.

Me:
> Create the jest.config.js file

ChatGPT:
The `jest.config.js` file is used to configure Jest, which is a JavaScript testing framework. Here's an example of how you might configure Jest for this project:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  roots: ['<rootDir>/tests'],
  testMatch: [
    '**/__tests__/**/*.+(ts|tsx|js)',
    '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).+(ts|tsx|js)',
  ],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node'],
};
```

In this configuration:

- The `roots` option is set to the `tests/` directory, which tells Jest to look for tests in this directory.
- The `testMatch` option is used to specify which files Jest should consider as test files. In this case, it's set to consider any `.ts`, `.tsx`, or `.js` file in the `__tests__` directory or any file elsewhere that ends with `.spec.ts`, `.spec.tsx`, `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `.spec.js`, or `.test.js` as a test file.
- The `transform` option is used to specify how Jest should transform files before testing them. Here, it's set to use `ts-jest` to transform any `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
- The `moduleFileExtensions` option is used to specify which file extensions Jest should consider when resolving modules. Here, it's set to consider `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.json`, and `.node` files.

Please note that this configuration assumes that you're using TypeScript. If you're using JavaScript, you can simplify the configuration like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  roots: ['<rootDir>/tests'],
  testMatch: [
    '**/__tests__/**/*.+(js)',
    '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).+(js)',
  ],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js)$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'json', 'node'],
};
```

In this simplified configuration, Jest is configured to use `babel-jest` to transform JavaScript files, and it only considers `.js`, `.json`, and `.node` files when resolving modules.
